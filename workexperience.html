                my subconscious thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
Recognizing the transformative potential of AI and health technology, I strive to also incorporate these advancements to develop and research new medical devices. In August 2022, during my four-month university exchange at the University of Sydney, I completed courses in e-health and Healthcare Business while volunteering at a healthcare clinic in Sydney, Australia. Volunteering as a physiotherapy assistant at the Haberfield Physiotherapy and Sports Injury Clinic provided me with the opportunity to serve senior patients and concurrently notice their challenges with health technology adoption and limited social networks. I acquired valuable insight into a new healthcare perspective for the aging population and Australia’s healthcare system. Witnessing the absence of adequate support in health technology and psychosocial barriers among the older population towards an active lifestyle has encouraged me to guide them to be more equipped for technological advancement and the necessity for health technologies to be inclusive to all elders. 

Since January 2023, I have actively worked in clinical procedures at the UBC Allan McGavin Sports Clinic, collaborating closely with the lead orthopedic surgeon Dr. Patrick Chin. I organized seamless patient flow and provided thorough pre- and post-operative care, demonstrating my commitment to operational efficiency and excellence in patient care. Monitoring the patient’s health metrics and the clinical IT increased my awareness of the potential for advanced monitoring systems, inspiring me to consider innovative solutions for redesigning patient intervention and improving the clinical workflow. In pursuit of enhancing my future endeavours, I am also enrolled in a computer science course, intending to enhance my understanding of programming languages and acquire applicable skills in the digital health realm. This experience, along with a future professional practicum at the University of Toronto within public health, will strategically position me to become a comprehensive professional in a health setting.
