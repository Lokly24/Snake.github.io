                    Recognizing the transformative potential of AI and health technology, I strive to also incorporate these advancements to develop and research new medical devices. In August 2022, during my four-month university exchange at the University of Sydney, I completed courses in e-health and Healthcare Business while volunteering at a healthcare clinic in Sydney, Australia. Volunteering as a physiotherapy assistant at the Haberfield Physiotherapy and Sports Injury Clinic provided me with the opportunity to serve senior patients and concurrently notice their challenges with health technology adoption and limited social networks. I acquired valuable insight into a new healthcare perspective for the aging population and Australiaâ€™s healthcare system. Witnessing the absence of adequate support in health technology and psychosocial barriers among the older population towards an active lifestyle has encouraged me to guide them to be more equipped for technological advancement and the necessity for health technologies to be inclusive to all elders.
